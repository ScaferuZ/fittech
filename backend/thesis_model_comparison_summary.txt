# Thesis Model Comparison: Data Pipeline and Experimental Design

## 1. Data Source and Initial Loading
- **Primary data**: Real user demographic and activity data loaded from `e267_Data on age, gender, height, weight, activity levels for each household member.txt`.
- **Data cleaning**: Remove rows with missing or invalid values (age, gender, height, weight, activity).
- **Demographic filtering**: Only adults aged 18-65 included.
- **Feature extraction**: Calculate BMI, BMI category, BMR, TDEE, and assign fitness goals using domain logic.

## 2. Data Splitting and Augmentation
- **EXACT 70/15/15 split** of real data:
  - 70% for training, 15% for validation, 15% for test (stratified by fitness goal).
- **Synthetic data generation**:
  - Only the training set is augmented with synthetic samples to balance fitness goal classes.
  - Synthetic samples are generated to match the distribution of real data (age, gender, BMI, activity, etc.).
- **Validation and test sets**: 100% real data, no synthetic samples.
- **All three experiments (rule-based, XGBoost, Random Forest) use the same splits** for fair comparison.

## 3. Feature Engineering
- **Physiological features**: age, height, weight, BMI, BMR, TDEE, activity multiplier, moderate/vigorous activity hours.
- **Interaction features**: age × BMI, TDEE per kg, activity intensity, height/weight ratio, BMR per kg, age × activity interaction.
- **Demographic features**: gender (one-hot), age groups (young/middle/older), BMI category (one-hot), activity level (one-hot).
- **All features are engineered identically for all models.**

## 4. Data Consistency and Usage Across Experiments
- **All models (rule-based, XGBoost, Random Forest) are trained and evaluated on the same data splits and features.**
- **No data leakage**: Validation and test sets are never used for training or hyperparameter tuning.
- **Augmentation only affects the training set.**

## 5. Model Implementations

### Rule-Based System
- **Implements deterministic template assignment logic** using domain rules (fitness goal, activity level, BMI category).
- **No hyperparameters**: Pure logic-based mapping.
- **Serves as the theoretical upper bound for template assignment accuracy.**

### XGBoost Model
- **Model type**: XGBoost multi-class classifier (one for workout, one for nutrition).
- **Hyperparameter optimization**:
  - RandomizedSearchCV with 20 iterations (workout) and 15 (nutrition).
  - 5-fold cross-validation, F1-weighted scoring.
  - Parameters tuned: n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate, min_child_weight, subsample, colsample_bytree, reg_alpha, reg_lambda, gamma.
  - Early stopping (30 rounds) on validation set.
- **Class imbalance handled**: Class weights computed and used in training.
- **Feature scaling**: StandardScaler applied to all features.
- **Label encoding**: LabelEncoder for template IDs.

### Random Forest Model
- **Model type**: Random Forest multi-class classifier (one for workout, one for nutrition).
- **Hyperparameter optimization**:
  - RandomizedSearchCV with 25 iterations (workout) and 20 (nutrition).
  - 5-fold cross-validation, F1-weighted scoring.
  - Parameters tuned: n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, max_features, bootstrap, class_weight.
- **Class imbalance handled**: Class weights set to 'balanced'.
- **Feature scaling**: StandardScaler applied to all features.
- **Label encoding**: Same as XGBoost for fair comparison.

## 6. Model Evaluation and Metrics
- **All models evaluated on the same real test set (15% of real data, never seen during training).**
- **Metrics reported**:
  - Accuracy, F1-score (weighted), precision, recall for both workout and nutrition template prediction.
  - Confusion matrices and ROC curves for all models.
  - Feature importance analysis for both XGBoost and Random Forest.
- **Rule-based system**: Evaluated on the same test set for direct comparison.

## 7. Pipeline Transparency and Reproducibility
- **All code and data splits are deterministic (random_state=42) for reproducibility.**
- **All models, scalers, and encoders are saved for future evaluation.**
- **All visualizations and summary tables are generated from the same pipeline.**

| Random Forest| Test        | Nutrition  | 0.655    | 0.630    | 0.617     | 0.655  |

**Notes:**
- Rule-based system is only evaluated on the test set (deterministic logic, not trained).
- XGBoost and Random Forest metrics are computed on the same splits and features for fair comparison.
- All metrics are for multi-class classification (weighted averages).
- Numbers are representative; use your actual output for publication.
