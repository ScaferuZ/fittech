THESIS MODEL COMPARISON SUMMARY
==================================================

1. RULE-BASED SYSTEM (Theoretical Upper Bound)
----------------------------------------
Workout Template Accuracy: 0.996 (99.6%)
Nutrition Template Accuracy: 0.993 (99.3%)
Overall Rule-based Accuracy: 0.995 (99.5%)

2. MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
----------------------------------------
XGBoost - Workout: 0.682, Nutrition: 0.622, Average: 0.652
Random Forest - Workout: 0.692, Nutrition: 0.655, Average: 0.673

3. KEY FINDINGS
----------------------------------------
• Rule-based system serves as the theoretical upper bound
• ML models show realistic performance given data limitations
• Performance gap reflects the deterministic nature of template assignment
• Results demonstrate the effectiveness of rule-based logic for this domain
